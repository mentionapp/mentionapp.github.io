				<p class="ac__content-descr"><strong>Welcome back to media monitoring 101! Today’s lesson is on media monitoring for market research.</strong></p>
				<p>Brand reputation management is an ongoing process, and for growing companies, staying on top of it is crucial for finding media opportunities and meeting and exceeding the demands of customer service.</p>
				<p>You have to engage where your people are, and the statistics show <a href="http://www.conversocial.com/blog/17-surprising-social-customer-service-statistics#.VZE1RxPtmko">they’re usually on social.</a></p>
				<p>67% of consumers reported contacting a company via social media to get customer service, and the cost of not responding is high. A failure to respond via social channels can lead to a 15% increase in the churn rate for existing customers.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/2bbiH">“You can’t afford not to monitor and measure the perception of your brand.”</a></p>
				<p>You must be watching where and how your brand’s being discussed, and responding to what’s being said by adjusting your messaging accordingly. Managing your brand’s perception is the art of entering and becoming part of a conversation that’s already happening.</p>
				<p><strong>Proactive and reactive media monitoring is the most effective way to manage your brand’s perception.</strong></p>
				<p>Today, we’re going to cover how you can use media monitoring to identify opportunities to create a better customer experience by effectively managing your brand.</p>
				

				<h2>How to Engage in Reactive Media Monitoring</h2>
				<p>This is something you probably already do with your social media. <strong>Reactive monitoring is the act of following up with people who are actively using or discussing your solution.</strong></p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/ad8oi">“Reactive monitoring is the act of following up with people already talking about you.”</a></p>
				<p>Reacting is low-hanging fruit. Your customer or potential customer mentions your brand, you address the situation, and ideally, they leave the interaction liking you better than when you started. Even in the event you can’t solve the problem, it’s still better than not responding at all.</p>
				<p>Additionally, before you see bad feedback about your brand, decide how you’re going to respond to it. It’s easy to slip into your lizard brain, get defensive, and say the exact wrong thing to your customer when they’ve given you an opportunity to serve them.</p>
				<p><strong>Negative feedback is an opportunity for growth</strong>. Take it and run with it. (And ignore the trolls.) </p>
				<p class="ac__key"><strong>Key Takeaway</strong>: There’s no reason not to respond to people talking about your brand. These conversations are low-hanging fruit.</p>
				<h3>How we do it at Instapage:</h3>
				<p>In this example, the user actually used our Twitter handle, but it’s worth noting that research shows 31% of company mentions on Twitter don’t use your handle. (And that’s just Twitter.) We responded to positive feedback by soliciting additional feedback in order to continue the conversation. Instapage is still a younger company, and we want to make early adopters feels special by reaching out to them.</p>

				<h2>How To Engage in Proactive Media Monitoring</h2>
				<p>Proactive monitoring is as much an art as it is a science.<strong>Proactive monitoring is the act of reaching out to someone who could use your solution before they have heard of you or directly engaged you.</strong></p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/7dak9">“Proactive monitoring is the act of reaching out to someone before they've heard of or engaged you.”</a></p>
				<p>Mention has made this incredibly easy with their software. Set up an alert for your brand, and engage where people are talking about you. Easy. However, there’s a much larger opportunity here for you. One effective tactic is setting and watching alerts for competitors as well.</p>
				<p>There are many ways you can use the information you glean from your competition’s audience, also known as your potential audience. Is something they’re pursuing that’s resonating with your right people? Are they completely missing an opportunity to serve?</p>
				<p>Don’t obsess over what your competition is or isn’t doing; that’s a great way to get stuck permanently in second place. Watch what they do, observe what isn’t working, and solve that problem better than they ever could.</p>
				<p>There is a fine line here on handling these sorts of interactions, and you’ll need to identify how your brand will handle this. You don’t want to look like an overly aggressive jerk, but you don’t want to miss the opportunity to engage with a potential new fan either.</p>
				<p>The most important thing to remember is you’re not looking for opportunities to sell. You’re looking for opportunities to serve.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/It4j9">““You’re not looking for opportunities to sell. You’re looking for opportunities to serve.”</a></p>
				<p class="ac__key"><strong>Key Takeaway</strong>: Create a plan for responding to people talking about competitors. You want to hit the right balance of persuasive and helpful.</p>
				<h3>How we do it at Instapage:</h3>
				<p>In this example, we reached out to someone who we identified as a highly qualified lead, thanks to setting up a Mention alert for a competitor’s name. The lead was ready to purchase a similar service already, and since we were able to offer him a better, more immediate solution to his problem, we took the initiative to let him know.</p>
				<p><em>Bonus tip:</em> Spell check your tweets before sending them, no matter how excited you are. *facepalm*</p>

				<h2>Best Practices:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Just like you use negative keywords for advertising opportunities, see if there’s a way to incorporate them into your media monitoring strategy.</li>
					<li>Be careful when employing more aggressive proactive monitoring techniques, and have a strategy in place.</li>
					<li>Watch before engaging! You need to get a good feel for customers and their problems before you jump into their conversation.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Putting this into action:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Set up alerts for your brand, main competitors, most valuable keywords, and negative keywords.</li>
					<li>Identify key pain points for your competitor’s audience - then solve them.</li>
					<li>React to people talking about your brand by replying to them and continuing the conversation.</li>
					<li>When you see someone unhappy with your competitor, jump into the conversation. However, don’t try to sell your own product, just help the user with their problems.</li>
				</ul>
