				<p class="ac__content-descr"><strong>Question: How valuable would it be to know exactly what your customers say about your product or service behind closed doors?</strong></p>
				<p>No filters, niceties, or pressure?</p>
				<p>Short of befriending every single customer and infiltrating their personal lives, what’s a marketer to do?</p>
				<p>Because if your customers don’t open up enough for you to know why your product is or isn’t performing, you’ve already lost.</p>
				<p>The fact is: most customers aren’t as candid to you in person as they are to their friends and family. They don’t trust you enough to open up to you.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/5B2IU">“Most customers aren't as candid with you as they are with their friends.”</a></p>
				<p>But there is a solution.</p>

				<h3>And that’s where media monitoring comes in.</h3>
				<p>We’ve all seen far too many tear-downs on Facebook to know that there’s something about typing behind a screen that gives most people the confidence to truly speak their minds.</p>
				<p>And tapping into this kind of openness can make the difference between meeting this month’s sales targets, or being left scratching your head and wondering why your latest offering just isn’t selling.</p>
				<p>Whether it’s researching what your customers think of your product, or the product of your competitors, media monitoring is your magnifying glass into the true thoughts of your customers.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/VmnUQ">“Media monitoring is your magnifying glass into the true thoughts of your customers.”</a></p>
				<p>So with that in mind, this lesson will cover what you can do with monitoring, including the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Using monitoring to supplement traditional market research</li>
					<li>Monitoring your niche for competitive analysis and lead gen opportunities</li>
					<li>How to effectively and efficiently use media monitoring for market research</li>
					<li>What you can do today to use media monitoring for market research</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Supplement traditional customer data</h2>
				<p>Traditional market research methods were always limited by time and budget:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Surveying the market is a great idea, until you have to analyze and make sense of the data.</li>
					<li>Focus groups are only as valuable as the time you spend with the participants.</li>
					<li>1-1 interviews take up far too much time, especially with a looming launch deadline.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Adding media monitoring to the mix complements them.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/l8tGo">“Media monitoring complements traditional market research, so use both together.”</a></p>
				<p>Monitoring is great for identifying <strong>what customers really think.</strong></p>
				<p>Customer research was previously all about surveys and focus groups. Once you’ve done these, turn to social media to answer questions like:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What’s their experience been with your product so far?</li>
					<li>If someone blogs about you, how does their audience react?</li>
					<li>What’s the response to stories about you in the media?</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="ac__key">Key Takeaway: Media monitoring gets you the true, honest opinions of your audience and customers. Use that information to supplement the other data you have.</p>

				<h2>Research your competitors</h2>
				<p>The second benefit of monitoring for market research is that you can learn more about your competitors without breaking the budget.</p>
				<p>You can buy your competitors’ products and services to experience them for yourself...or you can turn to social media (and the web in general) to not only monitor their new initiatives, but also their branding, customer interactions, and more.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/8KQAS">“Use social to learn more about your competitors, their products, and their customers.”</a></p>
				<p>Media monitoring helps you answer questions about your competitors, like:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What marketing campaigns are they running?</li>
					<li>When/why is there a spike in conversations about them?</li>
					<li>What new products are they developing?</li>
					<li>How do their customers perceive them?</li>
					<li>Where do they get PR from?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>From this, you can learn things like how they market their products, what customers think their strengths and weaknesses are, and more. You can use that information for your own marketing campaign and product development.</p>
				<p>And these competitor alerts have other uses, too. At Instapage, we set up a Mention alert for a competitor’s name. In addition to learning more about their products and customers, we reached out to someone who was a highly qualified lead.</p>
				<p>He was ready to purchase a similar product, so we took advantage of this to showcase our own.</p>
				<p>(Pro tip: Spell check your tweets before sending them!)</p>
				<img src="/academy/img/ac__l8-1.png" alt="">
				<p class="ac__key">Key Takeaway: Listening to what people say about your competitors will help your learn their strengths and weaknesses, as well as clarify your own.</p>

				<h2>Find your audience</h2>
				<p>The question is: how do you find where your customers are most vocal online?</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/OmA00">“Media monitoring can help you find where your customers are most vocal online.”</a></p>
				<p>Here are a few different ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Search Twitter</strong> for your brand and product names, important words, and phrases used in your customer research (surveys and interviews). Look at what other keywords and hashtags are commonly used in those conversations.</li>
					<li>
						Use Facebook’s open graph to find groups your customers are using:<br>
						- Type your keyword into the search bar <br>
						- Once you click the search icon, click the More button and select Groups. <br>
						- When you go into the group, Facebook also has a list of suggested groups that are similar to the one you’re in <br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Go to forums and blogs where your customers are. Find these by using Google to search: <br>
						- [your industry or product] + forum <br>
						- [your industry or product] + blog <br>
					</li>
					<li>Use Alltop.com to search for trends and media messages for products and services in your industry. This site aggregates all the latest stories for a certain topic, so it’s great for identifying new outlets.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Once you’ve followed the above steps to find keywords and outlets important to our audience, you’re all set to put that information into your monitoring tool and start seeking out conversations and intelligence.</p>
				<p>At Instapage, by creating Twitter alerts for our band name, we can constantly ask users for feedback or give them more support. It also means even if the person isn’t using our Twitter handle to write something about us, we’re still notified.</p>
				<p>Take this conversation as an example:</p>
				<img src="/academy/img/ac__l8-2.png" height="229" width="503" alt="">
				<p class="ac__key">Key Takeaway: Research on sites like Twitter, Facebook, and Alltop to identify the keywords and platforms your audience is using. Set up corresponding alerts in your monitoring tool.</p>


				<h2>Putting this into action</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>1. Look over research on your industry to identify keywords and phrases to monitor and create Mention alerts for them.</li>
					<li>2. Monitor alerts for your competitors to better understand how they’re perceived (and want to be perceived).</li>
					<li>3. Set up alerts for your brand name to find opportunities to get customer feedback.</li>
				</ul>
