				<p class="ac__content-descr"><strong>Our customers are our best product developers. On a daily basis, they give us free feedback through social media channels; how they are using our product, their go-to features, but most importantly, what can be improved. Inevitably, no matter how well iterated your product is, customers will hit roadblocks or bugs will surface from time to time. </strong></p>
				<p>At <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mailjet.com/">Mailjet</a>Mailjet, we see these as valuable learning opportunities. We use Mention to track these instances; sometimes we’re able to teach users new ways to use our product, other times they teach us a few new things. Ultimately using media monitoring for customer support helps eliminate customer frustration and identifies areas for us to further develop our product to deliver the best possible user experience.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/0F0c7">“Media monitoring eliminates customer frustration and identifies area for further product development.”</a></p>
				
				<h2>1. Be proactive and follow through</h2>
				<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.aspect.com/Documents/Papers/Aspect-NGCC-Forrester-WP.pdf">45% of US consumers will abandon an online transaction if their questions or concerns are not addressed quickly</a>. Build a social media support model that allows you to best leverage your team to quickly and comprehensively address social mentions.</p>
				<p>We’re lucky to have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mailjet.com/about-us">a global team at Mailjet</a> which allows us to conveniently provide 24/7 support across all time zones. While we work hard to deliver quality product, there are inevitably times where things break or a user can’t quite figure out how to use a feature as easily as we anticipated. We find the best way to win over a user’s trust is to be proactive and follow-up throughout the troubleshooting process.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/Qfa7s">“The best way to win over a user’s trust is to be proactive.”</a></p>
				<p>A little while back, Cedric, a customer of ours, found a bug where a crucial page they needed had disappeared. One of our marketing team members spotted this on our Mention feed and used the “share” button to communicate this issue to our tech team.</p>
				<img src="/academy/img/ac__l2-1.png" alt="">
				<img src="/academy/img/ac__l2-2.png" alt="">
				<img src="/academy/img/ac__l2-3.png" alt="">
				<p>From there, our support team was also made aware of the issue and was able to work closely with the tech team to help customers with a workaround until the bug was resolved. We were able to prevent potential frustration by noting the issue and keeping the affected customers updated. Because Cedric tweeted at us, we were also able to squash this bug before more users were affected.</p>
				<p>If you don’t do so already, identify key individuals from other teams that would be beneficial to the support process. We have a few developers, developer evangelists and sales managers sharing access to our Mention feed.</p>
				<p class="ac__key"><strong>Key Takeaway</strong>: Fully leverage your team to share responsibility and provide quality around the clock support.</p>


				<h2>2. Continue the conversation offline</h2>
				<p>Perhaps one of the more unconventional ways we use media monitoring is for offline support. Last spring, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mailjet.com/blog/the-title-of-your-blog-7a41e495-b181-46e0-b162-fe2572d24d87/">we were a sponsor at the TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon</a> where teams would be eligible to win additional prizes for the most creative hack using our API. There were hundreds of attendees, so it simply was not feasible for our Developer Evangelists to go table to table educating these teams as they were building.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/eeK46">“One of the more unconventional ways we use media monitoring is for offline support.”</a></p>
				<p>Media monitoring helped us keep track of trending discussions about our brand and developers who were using our APIs. By tracking our mentions we found out that our t-shirts were a huge hit, but also we were able to easily organize a running list of support needs. This not only eliminated an overcrowded booth of developers waiting in line with questions, <b>it also helped us ensure each user received adequate attention.</b></p>
				<p>We started by adding the alert “TC Disrupt” to help us track the tweets at the event. Not only did this help us easily sort through the couple thousand tweets we received over the course of a few days, but it also ensured that we caught tweets where people forgot to hashtag. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/frankdenbow">Frank</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/startupthreads">Startup Threads</a> had some issues with sending and we were able to quickly invite him back to our booth to get things running smoothly again.</p>
				<img src="/academy/img/ac__l2-4.png" alt="">
				<p class="ac__key"><strong>Key Takeaway</strong>: Online media monitoring can lead to deeper offline conversations. Always be on the lookout for additional ways to make customer support easier for you while providing more value for your users.</p>

				<h2>3. Take notes from your users</h2>
				<p>Last but certainly not least, <b>customer support goes beyond just ensuring a good customer experience today</b>. It’s also about creating a feedback loop to improve your product for tomorrow.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/ao28H">“Customer support goes beyond just ensuring a good customer experience today … it’s also about creating a better product tomorrow.”</a></p>
				<p>At <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mailjet.com">Mailjet</a>, we love when we see suggestions come through our Mention feed, whether its apps users would love to see integrations with, or new features that would make email easier.</p>
				<img src="/academy/img/ac__l2-5.png" alt="">
				<p>A lot of our features are driven by customer feedback. Most recently was the launch of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mailjet.com/feature/campaign-comparison/">Campaign Comparison</a> in May, which was developed after we saw customers asking for an easier way to compare historical email data to improve future sends.</p>
				<p>Our marketing and product teams work closely together using <a target="_blank" href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a>. In fact, I’m chatting with our Product Manager Sabrina Mamouni on a daily basis on Slack. Just the other day I was talking to her about improvements that could be made to our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mailjet.com/blog">blog’s</a> back-end CMS editor. Soon after, those requests were documented in Redmine and prioritized.</p>
				<p>Build a culture of transparency and communication between your marketing and product teams. Regularly educate one another on how customers are using your product and discuss ways to improve their experience.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/31l0R">“Make sure there’s transparency and clear communication between your marketing and product teams.”</a></p>
				<p class="ac__key"><strong>Key Takeaway</strong>: Listen to your customers to find your next feature to ship. Remain receptive to feedback both externally and internally.</p>

				<h2>Putting this into action:</h2>
				<p>These are just a few ways you can hack your customer support for success. The way you support your users will evolve as your product grows. Here’s what you can do today to get started:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Create 2-3 alerts in your media monitoring tool that will help you track technical issues and address them.</li>
					<li>Identify key team members outside of marketing and support that will gain value from having admin rights to these alerts. This can be someone from your product or developer team that can also help out on more technical questions.</li>
					<li>Engage in deeper conversations with customers that ask for support but also those that give feedback. Follow up with them and continue to track them over time.</li>
					<li>Use feedback to improve your customer support and build new features and products for the ultimate user experience. Build brand advocates by giving customers what they want.</li>
				</ul>
