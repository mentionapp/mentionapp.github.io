				<p class="ac__content-descr"><strong>Welcome to the Media Monitoring 101 Academy! You signed up, so you must already have an idea of the value that media monitoring can provide to your business. We’re here to provide you with the <b>why</b> and the <b>how</b> behind media monitoring’s application to your business.</strong></p>
				<p>Over the next seven weeks, we’ll hear from marketing experts from a variety of industries and companies, including Mailjet, Close.io, Instapage, and more.</p>
				<p>They will share their media monitoring success stories, best practices, actionable takeaways, and next steps to become better, more strategic listeners.</p>
				<p>Specifically, we’ll dive into how and why to leverage media monitoring for:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Support</li>
					<li>Lead Discovery</li>
					<li>Market Research</li>
					<li>Community Building</li>
					<li>Competitor Analysis</li>
					<li>Brand Reputation Management & PR</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The lessons will dive specifically into how media monitoring will impact these areas, but it’s important to first understand how listening to your audience will impact your bottom line and overall business goals, across departments.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>In this first lesson, we’re covering how media monitoring helps every team at your company grow your business and get achieve your individual department and overall goals.</p>
				
				<h2>1. Product & Support</h2>
				<p>No matter how much quality assurance you do, your customers will always be your number one bug finder. Sometimes they will come straight to you, other times, they will go to their community with their issue, whether they’re asking for help or just complaining.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/37wNr">“Your customers will always be your number one bug finder.”</a></p>
				<p>In fact, <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.mention.com/infographic-5-surprising-figures-you-need-to-know-to-improve-your-twitter-strategy/">our research shows</a> that 31% of company mentions on Twitter alone do not include the company’s handle. That’s 31% of communications you could be missing without implementing a media monitoring tool.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/3MYm5">“31% of company mentions on Twitter alone do not include the company’s handle.”</a></p>
				<p>Keep in mind, these could be people thinking about using your product or service - polling their personal networks for intel, an angry customer being vocal about an issue, or someone singing your praises.</p>
				<p>In any of these instances, <b>you need to be there and ready to respond and build a relationship</b>, which could lead to a sale or prevention of a lost customer.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/5RF2a">“Know what’s being said about your brand where -- be there and ready to build a relationship.”</a></p>
				<p class="ac__key">Key takeaway: ⅓ of your audience is talking about you, rather than to you. You need to be monitoring and joining these conversations, always adding value.</p>

				<h2>2. PR & Competitive Analysis</h2>
				<p>Monitor what people are saying about you to <b>measure their perception of your brand</b> and create the opportunity to take both reactive and proactive measures in tweaking your communications to better align your messaging with how you want to be perceived.</p>
				<p>With media monitoring, conduct research around how your competition is marketing themselves, and what is and isn’t resonating with their audiences (i.e. your potential audience).</p>
				<p>Additionally, <b>use media monitoring for market research around the problem your product solves</b>, further understanding what language your audience is using and how they’re communicating with each other. You can then adopt and adapt this messaging when you join the conversation. Speak to your audience how they want to be spoken to.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/f1j4U">“Use media monitoring to further understand what language your audience is using and how they’re communicating with each other.”</a></p>
				<p class="ac__key">Key takeaway: With media monitoring, you can learn crucial information about your audience in relation to your brand, competitors, and the problem you’re solving.</p>

				<h2>3. Community & Social Media Management</h2>
				<p>As you’re conducting all of this research via media monitoring, <b>make a list of where these conversations are happening, and who’s leading them</b>. These are your future distribution channels for content (i.e. forums, blog comments, news sites, or social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, or Instagram), and future potential brand ambassadors.</p>
				<p>A media monitoring tool, like Mention, will <b>flag certain people as “priority” or “influential”</b> based elements such as followers and Klout score. Do some research to discover their topics of interest and start a conversation. If they’re talking about topics relating to your brand often, they are potential members or even leaders of your community.</p>
				<p>Treat your early community members as you would beta customers and keep the group relatively small. After all, <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2013/07/psychology-of-scarcity.html">exclusivity makes people feel good</a></b>. Ask your new community members lots of questions -- actively collect feedback from them, then act on it. They’ll be happy to be a part of the process and will sing your brand’s praises to their networks.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/zvy0F">“Exclusivity makes people feel good. Treat your early community members like you would beta customers.”</a></p>
				<p class="ac__key">Key takeaway: Identify the people talking about you early on with media monitoring to recruit them as brand ambassadors and use them as beta testers.</p>

				<h2>4. Sales & Lead Generation</h2>
				<p>We’ve already covered how monitoring your own name, competitors’ names, and the problem your brand solves can be beneficial for community building, support, and branding. It gets even better. Media monitoring can have a <b>direct and measurable return</b> on your investment.</p>
				<p class="ac__cttw"><a href="http://ctt.ec/a7l8U">“Media monitoring can have a direct and measurable return on your investment.”</a></p>
				<p>By monitoring <b>specific events</b>, such as a competitor’s acquisition or closing -- or perhaps a regulation change, you can identify potential customers who are in desperate need of and searching for your product or services. As <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.mention.com/best-blog-ideas/">Nathan says in this post</a>, hundreds of people are crying for your offering, will you be there to respond.</p>
				<p>Steli of Close.io, as well as some of our other contributors will be diving deeper into how they were able to close deals thanks to catching the right conversations at the right time with media monitoring.</p>
				<p class="ac__key">Key takeaway: Always be paying attention to industry changes and trends for your chance to hear your potential customers’ cries for your offering.</p>

				<h2>Putting this into action</h2>
				<p>Now that we have a better understanding of how your entire team can use media monitoring to grow your business, it’s time to get to work. Here’s what you can do today to get started:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Implement a media monitoring tool of choice or at least start with an advanced search on Twitter of your brand’s name.</li>
					<li>Identify the places and hashtags being used as a vehicle for these conversations -- make a list.</li>
					<li>Identify and reach out to the people leading these conversations -- ask them questions about their interests and how you can help.</li>
					<li>Identify 2-3 key competitors and monitor their names, make note of what is driving engagement.</li>
					<li>Begin testing messages and topic ideas among your audience to gauge their reactions and learn more about what resonates with them.</li>
				</ul>
